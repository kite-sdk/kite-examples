        # extractAvroPaths is a command that uses zero or more avro path expressions to extract 
        # values from an Avro object. Each expression consists of a record output field name (on 
        # the left side of the colon ':') as well as zero or more path steps (on the right hand 
        # side), each path step separated by a '/' slash. Avro arrays are traversed with the '[]'
        # notation.
        #
        # The result of a path expression is a list of objects, each of which is added to the 
        # given record output field.
        # 
        # The path language supports all Avro concepts, including nested structures, records, 
        # arrays, maps, unions, etc, as well as a flatten option that collects the primitives in 
        # a subtree into a flat list.
